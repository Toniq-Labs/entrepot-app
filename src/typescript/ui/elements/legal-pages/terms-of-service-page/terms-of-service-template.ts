                    Because we have a growing number of services, we sometimes need to describe
                    additional terms for specific services. Those additional terms and conditions,
                    which are available with the relevant services, then become part of your
                    agreement with us if you use those services.

                            the Service offers a mobile component. You are solely responsible for
                            any fees, including Internet connection or mobile fees, that you incur

                            in which case those license terms will govern such software components.
                            For example, when you click to get more details about any of the Crypto
                            Assets sold through our marketplace, you might notice a third party link
                            to the website from which such Crypto Asset originated. Such website may
                            include license terms governing the use of such Crypto Asset. In the
                            event you purchase such Crypto Asset through our marketplace, you are
                            required to comply with such terms.

                    Toniq has always exercised judgment in allowing or disallowing certain assets,
                    listings, smart contracts, and collections consistent with the spirit of
                    openness in a worldwide community of users of a radical new technology. We
                    carefully consider the complete situation and all its details in light of our
                    policies before deciding to remove inappropriate assets, listings, smart
                    contracts, and collections when we discover them or they're brought to our
                    attention.

                    Assets, listings, smart contracts, and collections that Toniq deems

                    the rights to determine the appropriateness of listings on its site and remove
                    any listing at any time. If you create or offer an asset, listing, smart
                    contract, or collection in violation of these policies, we will take corrective
                    actions, as appropriate, including but not limited to removing the asset,
                    listing, smart contract, or collection, deleting your Toniq account, and
                    permanently withholding referral payments and developer revenue sharing fees.
                    Toniq cannot destroy or impound your assets or smart contracts, but we reserve
                    the right to destroy inappropriate metadata stored on our servers.

                            including but not limited to, the risk of purchasing counterfeit assets,
                            mislabeled assets, assets that are vulnerable to metadata decay, assets
                            on smart contracts with bugs, and assets that may become untransferable.
                            Toniq reserves the right to hide collections, contracts, and assets
                            affected by any of these issues or by other issues. Assets you purchase
                            may become inaccessible on Toniq. Under no circumstances shall the
                            inability to view your assets on Toniq serve as grounds for a claim
                            against Toniq.

                    Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
                    consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to
                    you. Some jurisdictions also limit disclaimers or limitations of liability for
                    personal injury from consumer products, so this limitation may not apply to
                    personal injury claims.
